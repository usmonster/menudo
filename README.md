# üçΩ Menudo

What's for lunch at the cantine? Menudo knows!

Given the ID of your preferred [TimeChef](https://timechef.elior.com/) restaurant and the URL for your incoming Slack webhook, Menudo will send you a timely notification of the day's menu once daily.

## TODO

* Make it a true Slack bot
* Incorporate dish popularity in display
* Parse & incorporate dish main ingredient in display (emoji?)
* Add "nutrition" facet ("Red Menu" style)
* Add "allergies" facet
* Add "/subscribe" command for individual notifications
* Make number of menus (days) configurable
* Make restaurant(s) configurable
* Make update timing configurable
* Add "/login" command for balance notifications
* Show all available menus for that account/day
